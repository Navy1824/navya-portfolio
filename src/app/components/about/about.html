      I'm a developer passionate about crafting software that is fast, dependable, and built to scale. I design Python-based backends that scale effortlessly, create intuitive frontends, and architect
      microservices & messaging systems that keep data moving in real time. Whether it's optimizing large-scale transactions or deploying cloud-native platforms on AWS & GCP, I love building
      products that are efficient, stable, and enjoyable to use.
